Supplementary Data for "On the Active Components in the Crystalline Li-Nb-O and Li-Ta-O Coating Materials"

Antisite-cif: Cif files of LiMO3 and Li3MO4 (M=Nb, Ta) with antisite defect complex (4 Vac_Li + 1 M_Li), where all possible Li vacancy sites are assigned with fractional occupancies. Distinct configurations are generated based on the cif files.

DFE-point: Defect formation energies of point defects (Vac_Li and M_Li) in LiMO3 and Li3MO4, including chemical potentials extracted from phase diagrams and correction energies.

NEB: Li-ion migration pathways in the environment of antisite defect complex within LiMO3 and Li3MO4. For Li3TaO4 with 3 unique Li sites, 11 pathways of low-vacancy limit are also attached.
