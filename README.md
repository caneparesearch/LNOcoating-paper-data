Supplementary Data for "On the Active Components in the Crystalline Li-Nb-O and Li-Ta-O Coating Materials", Chem. Mater. 2023 DOI: [10.1021/acs.chemmater.xxxxx](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.xxxxx).

The following folders contains:

- Antisite-cif: Cif files of computed models of LiMO<sub>3</sub> and Li<sub>3</sub>MO<sub>4</sub> (M=Nb, Ta) containing antisite defect complex (4 Vac<sub>Li</sub> + 1 M<sub>Li</sub>).
- DFE-point: Defect formation energies of point defects (Vac<sub>Li</sub> and M<sub>Li</sub>) in LiMO<sub>3</sub> and Li<sub>3</sub>MO<sub>4</sub>, including the chemical potentials extracted from the phase diagrams, as well as additional correction energy terms (with the Freysold method or the method by Kumagai and Oba).
- NEB: Li-ion migration pathways within LiMO<sub>3</sub> and Li<sub>3</sub>MO<sub>4</sub>, in the environment of antisite defect complex. For Li<sub>3</sub>TaO<sub>4</sub>, eleven pathways of low-vacancy limit are also attached.
